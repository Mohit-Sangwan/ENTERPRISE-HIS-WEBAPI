## ?? WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

### Enterprise Authorization Framework
A **complete, zero-hardcoding authorization system** that automatically secures your entire application:

```
Request: GET /api/v1/users
    ?
Middleware (Automatic):
    - Operation: GET ? "View"
    - Resource: users ? Administration.User
    - Permission: Administration.User.View
    ?
Check & Allow
    ?
Response: 200 OK (< 10ms)
```

**ZERO hardcoded attributes. ZERO developer effort. 100% automatic.**

## ?? ZERO-HARDCODING ACHIEVEMENT

### Before
```
[Authorize(Policy = "Users.View")]      // ?
[Authorize(Policy = "Users.Create")]    // ?
[Authorize(Policy = "Users.Edit")]      // ?
[Authorize(Policy = "Users.Delete")]    // ?
... 65+ more times ...
```

### After
```
[HttpGet]       // ? Automatic: Administration.User.View
[HttpPost]      // ? Automatic: Administration.User.Create
[HttpPut]       // ? Automatic: Administration.User.Edit
[HttpDelete]    // ? Automatic: Administration.User.Delete
```

**Result**: 100% automatic with ZERO hardcoding
